# SleepingBarberProblem
(The Sleeping Barber Problem [Dijktra, 1965]) A barbershop consists of a waiting room with 10 chairs and a barber room containing the barber chair. If there are no customers to be served, the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and finds the barber asleep, he wakes him up.     Write a deadlock-free program to coordinate the barber and the customers. Your code must be based on the producer-consumer discussed in class. The program must read the number of chairs and it must generate a customer randomly, the client arriving time must be between 0 and 3 seconds
